# Salifort Motors
This capstone project is to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm Salifort.
# Business scenario and problem
The HR department at Salifort Motors is seeking data-driven initiatives to improve employee satisfaction and retention. They have collected employee data but require assistance in leveraging it to understand turnover. As a data analytics professional, my goal is to analyze this data, build a model to predict employee departure, and provide insights into the factors driving attrition. Increasing employee retention is a key business objective, as finding and onboarding new employees is costly and time-consuming.
